This last expression can be described as follows: To compute the determinant of a 3 × 3 matrix A, multiply each entry in row 1 by a sign times the determinant of the 2 × 2 matrix obtained by deleting the row and column of that entry, and add the results. The signs alternate down row 1, starting with +. It is this
observation that we generalize below.
